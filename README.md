# fsharp.antlr

For now, I am trying to understand ANTLR and its potential in the context of the F# spec. This might develop into a project to create a F# ANTLR grammar. 

You should be able to create the parser and run the test set by
- opening the repo in a dev container
- running `dotnet run --project Test`
